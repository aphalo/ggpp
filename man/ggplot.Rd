\title{Create a new ggplot plot from time series data}
\usage{
\method{ggplot}{ts}(
  data,
  mapping = NULL,
  ...,
  time.resolution = "day",
  as.numeric = TRUE,
  environment = parent.frame()
)

\method{ggplot}{xts}(
  data,
  mapping = NULL,
  ...,
  time.resolution = "day",
  as.numeric = TRUE,
  environment = parent.frame()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Default spectrum dataset to use for plot. If not a spectrum, the
methods used will be those defined in package \code{ggplot2}. See \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}.
If not specified,
must be suppled in each layer added to the plot.}

\item{mapping}{Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot.
If not specified, in the case of spectral objects, a default mapping will
be used.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to methods. Not currently used.}

\item{time.resolution}{character The time unit to which the returned time
values will be rounded.}

\item{as.numeric}{logical If TRUE convert time to numeric, expressed as
fractional calendar years.}

\item{environment}{If an variable defined in the aesthetic mapping is not
found in the data, ggplot will look for it in this environment. It defaults
to using the environment in which \code{ggplot()} is called.}
}
\description{
\code{ggplot()} initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to
declare the input spectral object for a graphic and to optionally specify the
set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all
subsequent layers unless specifically overridden.
}
\details{
\code{ggplot()} is typically used to construct a plot
incrementally, using the + operator to add layers to the
existing ggplot object. This is advantageous in that the
code is explicit about which layers are added and the order
in which they are added. For complex graphics with multiple
layers, initialization with \code{ggplot} is recommended.

There are three common ways to invoke \code{ggplot}:
\itemize{
   \item \code{ggplot(ts, aes(x, y, <other aesthetics>))}
   \item \code{ggplot(ts)}
  }
The first method is recommended if all layers use the same
data and the same set of aesthetics, although this method
can also be used to add a layer using data from another
data frame. See the first example below. The second
method specifies the default spectrum object to use for the plot, and the
units to be used for y in the plot,
but no aesthetics are defined up front. This is useful when
one data frame is used predominantly as layers are added,
but the aesthetics may vary from one layer to another. The
third method specifies the default spectrum object to use for the plot,
but no aesthetics are defined up front. This is useful when
one spectrum is used predominantly as layers are added,
but the aesthetics may vary from one layer to another.
}
\note{
Current implementation does not merge default mapping with user
supplied mapping. If user supplies a mapping, it is used as is.
To add to the default mapping, aes() can be used by itself to compose
the ggplot.
