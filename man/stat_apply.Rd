\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}}. Only needs to be set at the layer level if you
are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data}

\item{.fun.x, .fun.y, .fun}{function to be applied or the name of the function
to be applied as a character string.}

\item{.fun.x.args, .fun.y.args, .fun.args}{additional arguments to be passed to
the function as a named list.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
layer}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same variables as the data input, with either a
  single or multiple rows, with the values of \code{x} and \code{y} variables
  replaced by the values returned by the applied functions, or possibly
  filled with \code{NA} if no function was supplied or available by default.
  If the applied function returns a named vector, the names are copied into
  columns \code{x.names} and/or \code{y.names}. If the summary function
  applied returns a one row data frame, it will be column bound keeping
  the column names, but overwritting columns x and/or y with y from the
  summary data frame. In the names returned by \code{.fun.x} the letter
  "y" is replaced by "x". These allows the use of the same functions as in
  \code{ggplot2::stat_summary()}.

  \describe{
  \item{x}{x-value as returned by \code{.fun.x}, with names removed}
  \item{y}{y-value as returned by \code{.fun.y}, with names removed}
  \item{x.names}{if the x-value returned by \code{.fun.x} is named, these names}
  \item{y.names}{if the y-value returned by \code{.fun.y} is named, these names}
  \item{xmin, xmax}{values returned by \code{.fun.x} under these names, if present}
  \item{ymin, ymax}{values returned by \code{.fun.y} under these names, if present}
  \item{<other>}{additional values as returned by \code{.fun.y} under other names}
  }
}
\description{
\code{stat_summary_xy()} and \code{stat_centroid()} are similar to
\code{ggplot2::stat_summary()} but summarize both \code{x} and \code{y}
values in the same plot layer. This makes it possible to highight the actual
location of the centroid with \code{geom_point()}, \code{geom_text()}, and
similar geometries. Instead, if we use \code{geom_rug()} they are only a
convenience avoiding the need to add two separate layers and flipping one of
them using \code{orientation = "y"}.
}
\details{
\code{stat_apply_group} applies functions to data.
When possible it is preferable to use transformations through scales or
summary functions such as \code{ggplot2::stat_summary()},
\code{stat_summary_xy()} or \code{stat_centroid()}. There are some
computations that are not scale transformations but are not usual summaries
either, as the number of data values does not decrease all the way to one row
per group. A typical case for a summary is the computation of quantiles. For
transformations are cumulative ones, e.g., using \code{cumsum()},
\code{runmed()} and similar functions. Obviously, it is always possible to
apply such functions to the data before plotting and passing them to a single
layer function. However, it can be useful to apply such functions on-the-fly
to ensure that grouping is consistent between computations and aesthetics.
One particularity of these statistics is that they can apply simultaneously
different functions to \code{x} values and to \code{y} values when needed. In
contrast to these statistics, \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_smooth}} applies a
function that takes both \code{x} and \code{y} values as arguments.

These four statistics are similar. They differ on whether they
  return a single or multiple rows of data per group.
}
\note{
The applied function(s) must accept as first argument a vector that
  matches the variables mapped to \code{x} or \code{y} aesthetics. For
  \code{stat_summary_xy()} and \code{stat_centroid()} the function(s) to be
  applied is(are) expected to return a vector of length 1 or a data frame
  with only one row. For \code{stat_apply_group} the vectors returned by the
  the functions applied to \code{x} and \code{y} must be of exactly the same
  length. When only one of \code{.fun.x} or \code{.fun.y} are passed a
  function as argument, the other variable in the returned data is filled
  with \code{NA_real_}. If other values are desired, they can be set by means
  of a user-defined function.
