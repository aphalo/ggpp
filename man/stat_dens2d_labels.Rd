\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. Only needs
to be set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
layer}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}

\item{keep.fraction}{numeric [0..1]. The fraction of the observations (or
rows) in \code{data} to be retained.}

\item{keep.number}{integer Set the maximum number of observations to retain,
effective only if obeying \code{keep.fraction} would result in a larger
number.}

\item{keep.sparse}{logical If \code{TRUE}, the default, observations from the
more sparse regions are retained, if \code{FALSE} those from the densest
regions.}

\item{keep.these, exclude.these}{character vector, integer vector, logical
vector or function that takes one or more variables in data selected by
\code{these.target}. Negative integers behave as in R's extraction methods.
The rows from \code{data} indicated by \code{keep.these} and
\code{exclude.these} are kept or excluded irrespective of the local
density.}

\item{these.target}{character, numeric or logical selecting one or more
column(s) of \code{data}. If \code{TRUE} the whole \code{data} object is
passed.}

\item{pool.along}{character, one of \code{"none"} or \code{"x"},
indicating if selection should be done pooling the observations along the
\emph{x} aesthetic, or separately on either side of \code{xintercept}.}

\item{xintercept, yintercept}{numeric The split points for the data filtering.}

\item{invert.selection}{logical If \code{TRUE}, the complement of the
selected rows are returned.}

\item{h}{vector of bandwidths for x and y directions. Defaults to normal
reference bandwidth (see bandwidth.nrd). A scalar value will be taken to
apply to both directions.}

\item{n}{Number of grid points in each direction. Can be scalar or a length-2
integer vector}

\item{label.fill}{character vector of length 1, a function or \code{NULL}.}

\item{return.density}{logical vector of lenght 1. If \code{TRUE} add columns
\code{"density"} and \code{"keep.obs"} to the returned data frame.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\description{
\code{stat_dens2d_labels()} Sets values mapped to the
  \code{label} aesthetic to \code{""} or a user provided character string
  based on the local density in regions of a plot panel. Its main use is
  together with repulsive geoms from package \code{\link[ggrepel]{ggrepel}}.
  If there is no mapping to \code{label} in \code{data}, the mapping is set
  to \code{rownames(data)}, with a message.
}
\details{
\code{stat_dens2d_labels()} is designed to work together with
  geometries from package 'ggrepel'. To avoid text labels being plotted over
  unlabelled points all the rows in data need to be retained but
  labels replaced with the empty character string, \code{""}. Function
  \code{\link{stat_dens2d_filter}} cannot be used with the repulsive geoms
  from 'ggrepel' because it drops observations.

  \code{stat_dens2d_labels()} can be useful also in other situations, as the
  substitution character string can be set by the user by passing an argument
  to \code{label.fill}. If this argument is \code{NULL} the unselected rows
  are filtered out identically as by \code{stat_dens2d_filter}.

  The local density of observations in 2D (\emph{x} and \emph{y}) is computed
  with function \code{\link[MASS]{kde2d}} and used to select observations,
  passing to the geom all the rows in its \code{data} input but with with the
  text of labels replaced in those "not kept". The default is to select
  observations in sparse regions of the plot, but the selection can be
  inverted so that only observations in the densest regions are returned.
  Specific observations can be protected from having the label replaced by
  passing a suitable argument to \code{keep.these}. Logical and integer
  vectors function as indexes to rows in \code{data}, while a character
  vector is compared to values in the variable mapped to the \code{label}
  aesthetic. A function passed as argument to \code{keep.these} will receive
  as its first argument the values in the variable mapped to \code{label} and
  should return a character, logical or numeric vector as described above.

  How many labels are retained intact in addition to those in
  \code{keep.these} is controlled with arguments passed to \code{keep.number}
  and \code{keep.fraction}. \code{keep.number} sets the maximum number of
  observations selected, whenever \code{keep.fraction} results in fewer
  observations selected, it is obeyed.

  Computation of density and of the default bandwidth require at least
  two observations with different values. If data do not fulfill this
  condition, they are kept only if \code{keep.fraction = 1}. This is correct
  behavior for a single observation, but can be surprising in the case of
  multiple observations.

  Parameters \code{keep.these} and \code{exclude.these} make it possible to
  force inclusion or exclusion of observations after the density is computed.
  In case of conflict, \code{exclude.these} overrides \code{keep.these}.

  In normal use a character variable is mapped to the \code{label} aesthetic,
  but if no mapping is present, the row names are used instead of the missing
  aesthetic mapping. In either case the "filtered-out" labels are replaced by
  the value passed to \code{label.fill}. This can be useful to identify the
  observations.
}
\note{
Which points are kept and which not depends on how dense a grid is used
  and how flexible the density surface estimate is. This depends on the
  values passed as arguments to parameters \code{n}, \code{bw} and
  \code{kernel}. It is also important to be aware that both
  \code{geom_text()} and \code{geom_text_repel()} can avoid overplotting by
  discarding labels at the plot rendering stage, i.e., what is plotted may
  differ from what is returned by this statistic.
