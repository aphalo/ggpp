\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. Only needs to be
set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data.}

\item{position}{The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
layer}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}

\item{keep.fraction}{numeric vector of length 1 or 2 [0..1]. The fraction of
the observations (or rows) in \code{data} to be retained.}

\item{keep.number}{integer vector of length 1 or 2. Set the maximum number of
observations to retain, effective only if obeying \code{keep.fraction}
would result in a larger number.}

\item{keep.sparse}{logical If \code{TRUE}, the default, observations from the
more sparse regions are retained, if \code{FALSE} those from the densest
regions.}

\item{keep.these, exclude.these}{character vector, integer vector, logical
vector or function that takes one or more variables in data selected by
\code{these.target}. Negative integers behave as in R's extraction methods.
The rows from \code{data} indicated by \code{keep.these} and
\code{exclude.these} are kept or excluded irrespective of the local
density.}

\item{these.target}{character, numeric or logical selecting one or more
column(s) of \code{data}. If \code{TRUE} the whole \code{data} object is
passed.}

\item{pool.along}{character, one of \code{"none"} or \code{"x"},
indicating if selection should be done pooling the observations along the
\emph{x} aesthetic, or separately on either side of \code{xintercept}.}

\item{xintercept}{numeric The split point for the data filtering. If
\code{NA} the data are not split.}

\item{invert.selection}{logical If \code{TRUE}, the complement of the
selected rows are returned.}

\item{bw}{numeric or character The smoothing bandwidth to be used. If
numeric, the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel. If character, a
rule to choose the bandwidth, as listed in \code{\link[stats]{bw.nrd}}.}

\item{kernel}{character See \code{\link{density}} for details.}

\item{adjust}{numeric A multiplicative bandwidth adjustment. This makes it
possible to adjust the bandwidth while still using the a bandwidth
estimator through an argument passed to \code{bw}. The larger the value
passed to \code{adjust} the stronger the smoothing, hence decreasing
sensitivity to local changes in density.}

\item{n}{numeric Number of equally spaced points at which the density is to
be estimated for applying the cut point. See \code{\link{density}} for
details.}

\item{return.density}{logical vector of lenght 1. If \code{TRUE} add columns
\code{"density"} and \code{"keep.obs"} to the returned data frame.}

\item{orientation}{character The aesthetic along which density is computed.
Given explicitly by setting orientation to either \code{"x"} or \code{"y"}.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether \code{NA} values should be
stripped before the computation proceeds.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\value{
A plot layer instance. Using as output \code{data} a subset of the
  rows in input \code{data} retained based on a 1D filtering criterion.

\description{
\code{stat_dens1d_filter} Filters-out/filters-in observations in
  regions of a plot panel with high density of observations, based on the
  values mapped to one of \code{x} and \code{y} aesthetics.
  \code{stat_dens1d_filter_g} does the same filtering by group instead of by
  panel. This second stat is useful for highlighting observations, while the
  first one tends to be most useful when the aim is to prevent clashes among
  text labels. By default the data are handled all together, but it is also
  possible to control labeling separately in each tail.
}
\details{
The 1D density of observations of \emph{x} or \emph{y} is computed
  with function \code{\link[stats]{density}} and used to select observations,
  passing to the geom a subset of the rows in its \code{data} input. The
  default is to select observations in sparse regions of the plot, but the
  selection can be inverted so that only observations in the densest regions
  are returned. Specific observations can be protected from being deselected
  and "kept" by passing a suitable argument to \code{keep.these}. Logical and
  integer vectors work as indexes to rows in \code{data}, while a values in a
  character vector are compared to the character values mapped to the
  \code{label} aesthetic. A function passed as argument to keep.these will
  receive as argument the values in the variable mapped to \code{label} and
  should return a character, logical or numeric vector as described above. If
  no variable has been mapped to \code{label}, row names are used in its
  place.

  How many rows are retained in addition to those in \code{keep.these} is
  controlled with arguments passed to \code{keep.number} and
  \code{keep.fraction}. \code{keep.number} sets the maximum number of
  observations selected, whenever \code{keep.fraction} results in fewer
  observations selected, it is obeyed. If `xintercept` is a finite value
  within the \emph{x} range of the data and \code{pool.along}
  is passed \code{"none"} the data as are split into two groups
  and \code{keep.number} and \code{keep.fraction} are applied separately to
  each tail with density still computed jointly from all observations. If the
  length of \code{keep.number} and \code{keep.fraction} is one, this value
  is used for both tails, if their length is two, the first value is use
  for the left tail and the second value for the right tail.

  Computation of density and of the default bandwidth require at least
  two observations with different values. If data do not fulfill this
  condition, they are kept only if \code{keep.fraction = 1}. This is correct
  behavior for a single observation, but can be surprising in the case of
  multiple observations.

  Parameters \code{keep.these} and \code{exclude.these} make it possible to
  force inclusion or exclusion of observations after the density is computed.
  In case of conflict, \code{exclude.these} overrides \code{keep.these}.
}
\note{
Which points are kept and which not depends on how dense and flexible
  is the density curve estimate. This depends on the values passed as
  arguments to parameters \code{n}, \code{bw} and \code{kernel}. It is
  also important to be aware that both \code{geom_text()} and
  \code{geom_text_repel()} can avoid over plotting by discarding labels at
  the plot rendering stage, i.e., what is plotted may differ from what is
  returned by this statistic.
