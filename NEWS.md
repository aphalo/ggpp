# ggpp 0.5.9

- Ensure compatibility with upcoming 'ggplot2' 4.0.0.
- When used with 'ggplot2' 4.0.0 support parameter `reverse` in 
`position_dodge_keep()`, `position_dodgenudge()` and `position_dodgenudge_to()`.
- Add `position_dodgenudge_to()` and `position_dodge2nudge_to()` that allow the 
action of `position_nudge_to()` to be combined with dodging.
- Add `position_stacknudge_to()` and `position_fillnudge_to()` that allow the 
action of `position_nudge_to()` to be combined with stacking.
- Update `geom_table()`, `geom_table_npc()` and the table-theme constructors to 
support transparency with the `alpha` aesthetic.

# ggpp 0.5.8-1

-  Fix wrong test for availability of 'gginnards' in examples (reported by
_Joshua Ulrich_ in issue #53).
-  Add to vignette _Combining repulsion and nudging_ three missing tests for 
availability of package 'ggrepel'.
-  Revise `position_nudge_to()` to support expansion and contraction of the
range within which to spread the positions.

# ggpp 0.5.7

Track changes in 'ggplot2' 3.5.0 and 3,5,1. Fix a couple of minor
incompatibilities. Add some new features matching those new in 'ggplot2'.
General improvements and bug fixes.

-   This version depends on 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0.
-   Add helper function `wrap_labels()`, useful to insert new lines into
characters strings stored in a vector.
-   Add `as_npc()`, `as_npcx()` and `as_npcy()` helper functions that translate
positions given as character strings into numeric values in [0..1] corresponding
to NPC (Normalised Parent Coordinates) and validate the range of numeric values
if passed directly as arguments. The returned values belong to class `AsIs` and
ready to use in aesthetic mappings.
-   Update `geom_point_s()` adding parameter `move.point` to allow its use to 
highlight points at the original position with an arrow with its start given by 
the displacement by a position function.
-   Change in `geom_point_s()` the end at which the tip of the arrow is drawn,
to its most frequently used direction, even if opposite to the default for
`geom_text_s()` and `geom_label_s()`.
-   Update `geom_text_s()`, `geom_label_s()`. `geom_text_pairwise()` and 
`geom_label_pairwise()` adding parameter `size.unit` tracking change in 
`geom_text()` and `geom_label()` in 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0.
-   Update `geom_text_s()`, `geom_label_s()`. `geom_text_pairwise()` and 
`geom_label_pairwise()` so that graphic elements in the keys match those in
the plot, even when using the additional features available in 'ggplot2' in
>= 3.5.0.
-   Update `geom_text_s()`, `geom_label_s()`. `geom_text_pairwise()` and 
`geom_label_pairwise()` so that they respect the `alpha` component of
color defintions.
-   Update `stat_fmt_table()` to allow application of functions to columns.
-   Fix in `geom_text_s()`, `geom_label_s()`. `geom_text_pairwise()` and 
`geom_label_pairwise()` an infrequent problem with incomplete guides in 
'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0.
-   Fix bug in `geom_point_s()`, `alpha_target = "point"` ignored.
-   Fix bug in `geom_label_s()`, `colour_target = "box.line"` ignored.
-   Fix bug in in `shrink_segments()` giving a spureous error with totel 
shrinkage > 1 mm. Affecting all geometries with formal parameters `box.padding` 
and `point.padding`.

# ggpp 0.5.6

-   Fix bug in `stat_density2d_filter()`.
-   Fix bug in `position_dodgenudge()`, behaviour like `position_dodge2nudge()`.
-   Improve handling of nudging with `x` or `y` nudge vectors longer than one
    but shorter than the number of rows in `data` by reordering them based on
    the ordering of the data values to which they are applied.

# ggpp 0.5.5

-   Update for compatibility with upcoming 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0.
-   Support the `angle` aesthetic in `geom_label_npc()`, `geom_label_s()` and 
`geom_label_pairwise()` matching the upcoming update to `ggplot2::geom_label()` 
(with help from _teunbrand_).
-   Add support for `linetype` aesthetic to `geom_label_npc()`, for consistency
with `geom_label_s()` and `geom_label_pairwise()`.
-   Add `position_stack_minmax()` to correctly position error bars in stacked plots.
-   Add data sets `birch.df`and `birch_dw.df` with data for 350 birch seedlings.
-   Add data set `weather_18_june_2019.df` with data at 1 min interval for 24 h.
-   Move transcriptomics data sets `quadrant_example.df` and `volcano_example.df` from 'ggpmisc' to 'ggpp'.

# ggpp 0.5.4

-   Add `geom_text_pairwise()` and `geom_label_pairwise()`suitable for 
annotating/highlighting pairwise comparisons between levels of a factor mapped to the _x_ aesthetic. They can also be used to highlight ranges of values when the variable mapped to _x_ is a continuous numerical vector. The user interfaces are consistent with those of `geom_text_s()` and `geom_label_s()`.
-   Improve handling of nudge values when dates or times are mapped to _x_ or
_y_.

# ggpp 0.5.3

-   Add support for percent and fraction of observations to `stat_quadrant_counts()` 
and `stat_group_counts()`.
-   Fix bug in `stat_group_counts()`: mismatch between counts and groups.
-   Add `stat_functions()`, a replacement for `ggplot2::stat_function()` that fully 
complies with the grammar of graphics, supporting multiple functions per layer,
grouping and facets.
-   Add examples to documentation.

# ggpp 0.5.2

-   Fix bug in `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()`: handle elegantly data for which density cannot be
estimated (Issue #32 raised by mshubert to report bug).
-   In `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` use `type = 8` when computing quantiles, instead of the
default `type = 7`. Type 8 is recommended as better with data that are not
normally distributed.
-   Add parameter `exclude.these` to `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` allowing forcing the exclusion of specific observations
irrespective of the local density (See issue #19, partly addressing a suggestion by mshubert).
-   In `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` add parameter `these.target` making it possible
to apply a function or vector of values passed through `exclude.these` or `keep.these` to any variable in the layer `data` 
(See issue #19, partly addressing a suggestion by mshubert).
-   Implement `"spread"` action in `position_nudge_to()`.
-   Fix bug in segment shrinking (very rare division by zero).
-   Changed default values for `colour.target` to improve consistency; now
segments are never the target of colour by default.
-   Add formal parameters `color.target` and `default.colors` as synonyms of `colour.target` and `default.colours`.
-   Add unit tests. (See issue #10, and pull requests #12, #13, #17, #18, #21, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #30, #31, #34 and #38 from Daniel Sabanes Bove and his team).
-   Add checks for string arguments; improve some obscure error messages.
-   Track deprecation of `aes_string()` in 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0).

# ggpp 0.5.1

-   Add parameter `keep.these` to `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` allowing forcing the inclusion of specific observations
irrespective of the local density (See issue #19, partly addressing a suggestion by mshubert).
-   Update `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` to allow separate control of kept observations or
labels in each tail (1D) or in each quadrant (2D) of the density distribution,
still using an estimate of the local density computed from the whole data set.
-   Add parameter `return.density` to `stat_dens2d_labels()`, `stat_dens2d_filter()`,
`stat_dens2d_filter_g()`, `stat_dens1d_labels()`, `stat_dens1d_filter()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` to request the local density estimate at the position
of each observation to be returned in numeric variable `density` and the outcome
of the test in logical variable `keep`.

# ggpp 0.5.0

-   Add `stat_panel_counts()` and `stat_group_counts()`.
-   Add parameters `default.colour` and `colour.target` to `geom_label_s()`,
    `geom_text_s()`, `geom_point_s()`, `geom_plot()`, `geom_table()` and `geom_grob()`.
-   Add parameters `default.alpha` and `alpha.target` to `geom_label_s()`,
    `geom_text_s()`, `geom_point_s()`, `geom_plot()`, `geom_table()` and `geom_grob()`.
-   **Code breaking.** Remove support for aesthetics `segment.colour`,
    `segment.alpha`, and `segment.size` in `geom_label_s()`,
    `geom_text_s()`, `geom_point_s()`, `geom_plot()`, `geom_table()` and `geom_grob()`. (Segments 
    are links, and not meant to inform about data values on their own.)
-   Add vignette "Combining repulsion and nudging" describing the plot features
    made possible by packages 'ggpp' (>= 0.5.0) and 'ggrepel' 
    (>= 0.9.2) when used together.

# ggpp 0.4.5

-   Add function `dark_or_light()`.
-   Support the new 'ggplot2' aesthetic `linewidth` in `geom_quadrant_lines()`
    and `geom_vhlines()` for compatibility with 'ggplot2' (>= 3.3.7).
-   Update `geom_text_s()` and `geom_label_s()` to support justification 
    computed from positions, with `hjust = "position"` and 
    `vjust = "position"` as new defaults. (The current, very simple, approach
    will be further tested and if necessary improved for the next release.)
-   Update `geom_text_s()` and `geom_label_s()` to enable `segment.size`
    aesthetic and increase its default value, and add formal parameters 
    `point.padding`, `box.padding` and `min.segment.length` to allow adjusting
    the length of the segments.
-   Update `position_nudge_center()` for compatibility with 'ggplot2' 
    (>= 3.3.7) and to ensure that every label gets nudged even if located
    exactly at the center (focus point of nudging).

# ggpp 0.4.4

Multiple grobs and grob trees sharing the same name result in only the first
one being rendered. This caused problems when multiple layers created with
the same geometry were added to a plot.

-   Fix bug caused by grob and grob tree naming. Until unique naming is
    implemented, we do not assign names in cases where these potentially
    can interfere with rendering. This bug affected most geometries in 'ggpp'.

# ggpp 0.4.3

Based on issues raised in the GitHub repository of 'ggrepel' and the
nudge functions added some time ago to package 'ggpp' it became obvious
that nudging can help in achieving good repulsion outcomes without need
of tailored repulsion algorithms for specific cases. Obviously
developing new ggplot *position* functions is much easier than tweaking
the repulsion algorithm. It is also clear that not being able to combine
nudging with stack, jitter and dodge positions made difficult to produce
some types of plots. One case is replacing a key or legend with direct
labels to plot elements, which is important in plots aimed at audiences
outside academia.

In one of the issues in the GitHub repository of 'ggrepel' an answer by
*M. Krassowski* included code that provided an elegant and simple
approach to implementing combined position functions without duplicating
code already in 'ggplot2' by instead calling methods of the parent
class. I edited this code and included it in the package.

Except for the position functions with names ending in `_keep`, for
which *normal* counterparts exist, the *keeping* of the original
position can be disabled by passing `kept.origin = "none"` when they are
called.

The renaming of `geom_text_linked()` to `geom_text_s()` is code breaking
but I am now fairly confident this shorter name is easy to remember with
`s` for segment.

-   Add functions `position_stack_keep()`, `position_fill_keep()`,
    `position_jitter_keep()`, `position_dodge_keep()` and
    `position_dodge2_keep()`.
-   Add functions `position_stacknudge()`, `position_fillnudge()`,
    `position_jitternudge()`, `position_dodgenudge()` and
    `position_dodge2nudge()` based on code by M. Krassowski for
    `position_stack_and_nudge()`.
-   Revise functions `position_nudge_to()`, `position_nudge_center()`
    and `position_nudge_line()` adding support for disabling keeping of
    the original positions.
-   Add `geom_point_s()` and `geom_label_s()` and update `geom_text_s()`
    **renamed** from `geom_text_linked()`. This is a ***code breaking
    change*** with respect to the previous (unstable) version.
-   Update `geom_plot()`, `geom_table()` and `geom_grob()` to support
    plotting of segments when positions change, e.g., with nudging.
-   Update the vignette.

With 12 new and four partly rewritten functions there is quite a lot of
new code in this update, so even if tested and checked, it is possible
that bugs may have slipped through. Please, do report them if you
encounter any.

# ggpp 0.4.2

The initial implementation and user interface of three *apply*
statistics first introduced in 'ggpmisc' 0.3.6 has been revised to
expand their usefulness and to make them less error-prone, while the
fourth one is now defunct. **Note:** The default argument for `geom`
in`stat_centroid()` is likely to change in the near future. Otherwise,
the three statistics can be considered now stable.

-   Update `stat_apply_group()` to support summary functions like
    `quantile()` that return vectors with more than one value but
    shorter than the original number of observations.

-   Update `stat_summary_xy()` and `stat_apply_group()` to return `NA`
    in `x` and/or `y` when `.fun.x` or `.fun.y` are not passed an
    argument. This is a ***code breaking change*** with respect to the
    previous (unstable) version.

-   Update `stat_summary_xy()` and `stat_centroid()` to support
    functions that return a one row data frame, like those defined in
    'ggplot2' to be passed as argument to parameter `fun.data` of
    `ggplot2::stat_summary()`, such as `mean_se`, `mean_cl_boot` , etc.

-   Fix bug in `stat_centroid()`, `stat_summary_xy()` and
    `stat_apply_group()` resulting in the return of a long data frame
    with `NA` values instead of a data frame with fewer rows.

-   Remove `stat_apply_panel()` , as it was redundant. Grouping can be
    modified per layer when needed.

# ggpp 0.4.1

-   Update `compute_just2D()` and `compute_just()` to work with any
    value for the `angle` aesthetic, as in the accepted version of the
    pull request in 'ggplot2'.

-   Fix bug in `geom_table()` that would cause text left or right
    justified to be clipped when the text in a cell was very long
    (reported by *dryguy*). (Cell padding still needs improvement.)

# ggpp 0.4.0

This new package is the result of splitting package 'ggpmisc' into two
packages: 'ggpp' containing extensions to the grammar of graphics and
'ggpmisc' containing extensions to 'ggplot2' related to plot decorations
based on model fits, statistical summaries and other descriptors of the
data being plotted. Package 'ggpmisc' depends on 'ggpp' with no visible
changes for users. Package 'ggpp' can be loaded instead of 'ggpmisc'
when only the extensions it contains are needed. Package 'gginnards'
containing tools for editing ggplot objects as well as tools for
inspecting them is an earlier spin-off from 'gpmisc'.

Compared to 'ggpmisc' 0.3.9, the following changes have been introduced.
New justification styles have being implemented to complement
`position_nudge_center()` . They are supported in `geom_text_s()`,
`geom_plot()`, `geom_table()`, `geom_grob()` and `geom_marging_grob()`.
In the current implementation all rows in `data` should contain the same
`hjust` or `vjust` value when using the new types of justification
described here, this seems reasonable as they compute the individual
justification values from the data. All other justification values,
either `numeric` or `character` do not have this restriction and can be
used as in *geoms* from 'ggplot2'. *These new features may change in the
near future*.

-   Rename `geom_linked_text()` into `geom_text_linked()`.
-   Implement justifications `"outward_mean"` , `"inward_mean"` ,
    `"outward_median"` and `"inward_median"` so that outward and inward
    are with respect to the centroid of the data instead of to the
    middle of the $x$ or $y$ scales. This should be useful in
    combination with `position_nudge_center()`.
-   Implement justifications `"outward_nnn"` and `"inward_nnn"` so that
    outward and inward are with respect to the number resulting from
    applying `as.numeric()` to the characters that replace `nnn`. For
    example strings like `"outward_0.5"` , `"inward_3e5"` or
    `"outward_-3e-2"` are supported. This should be useful when manual
    tweaking is desired. As special cases `"outward_0"` and `"inward_0"`
    apply justification outward and inward with respect to the origin.
    This should be useful for biplots used for PCA and similar cases
    with arrows radiating out of the origin. (The `"outward"` and
    `"inward"` justification implemented in 'ggplot2' is relative to the
    middle of the $x$ or $y$ scales.)
-   Revise `compute_npcx()` and `compute_npcy()` to support multiple
    steps per group (needed in 'ggpmisc').
-   Fix problem related to `"outward"` and `"inward"` justification of
    text labels when `angle` aesthetic takes values \< -45 or > 45
    degrees. This code change alters how old plots are rendered if text
    labels have been rotated by more than 45 degrees.
-   'ggplot2', 'ggrepel': The problem with angle was a "bug" in
    'ggplot2' also present in 'ggrepel'. A pull request for
    `ggplot2::geom_text()` has been submitted and merged. This is now in
    the 'ggplot2' 3.3.4 milestone retaining consistent behaviour between
    'ggplot2', 'ggrepel', 'ggpp' and 'ggpmisc'.

# ggpmisc 0.3.9

-   Update the documentation of `geom_plot()`.
-   Revise handling of rounding for $R^2$ and $P$-value in
    `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   **Under development!** Link repositioned text to its original
    position with a segment or arrow: `geom_linked_text()`. Except for
    the drawing of segments or arrows this new *geometry* behaves as
    `ggplot2::geom_text()` . *Note:* Segments and arrows are drawn only
    if the position function used returns both the repositioned and
    original coordinates.
-   Add support for advanced nudging: `position_nudge_centre()` and
    `position_nudge_line()` compute the direction of nudging and return
    both the nudged and original positions.
-   Add support for simple nudging: `position_nudge_to()` nudges to new
    user-supplied position(s); `position_nudge_keep()` nudges to
    position(s) based on user-supplied position shift. These functions
    return both nudged and original position(s), which makes possible to
    draw connecting segments from text labels to the original position.

# ggpmisc 0.3.8-1

-   Fix bug: suggested package not loaded in vignette *Model-Based Plot
    Annotations* resulting in "method not found" warning in some
    examples*.*

# ggpmisc 0.3.8

-   **CODE BREAKING:** functions `stat_fit_glance()` ,
    `stat_fit_augment()` , `stat_fit_tidy()` and `stat_fit_tb()` now
    import the *tidiers* from package 'generics' instead of from
    'broom'. As a result, users must now explicitly load the package
    where the methods to be used are defined, such as 'broom' or
    'broom.mixed' or define them before calling these statistics.
-   Add formal parameter `glance.args` to `stat_fit_glance()` ,
    parameter `tidy.ars` to `stat_fit_tidy()` and `stat_fit_tb()` and
    parameter `augment.args` to `stat_fit_augment()` as some
    specializations of `broom::glance()`, `broom::tidy()` and
    `stat_fit_augment()` accept arguments specific to a given fitting
    method.
-   Fix bug: `stat_fit_tidy()` would fail with `quantreg::rq()` and any
    other fit methods that do not return by default standard error
    estimates for parameter estimates (Thanks to Mark Neal for reporting
    the problem).
-   Revise `stat_fit_glance()`, `stat_fit_augment()` and
    `stat_fit_tidy()` to ensure compatibility with `cor.test()` and
    other functions that require an object rather than a quoted
    expression as argument for `data` .
-   Add formal parameter `p.digits` to `stat_fit_tb()`.
-   New vignette explaining how the grammar of graphics has been
    expanded to better support annotations.
-   Fix bug: `try_tibble.ts()` and `try_data_frame()` did not handle
    correctly the conversion of dates for some time series, which also
    could affect `ggplot.ts()`.
-   Fix bug: `stat_peaks()` and `stat_valleys()` generated wrong labels
    if a `Date` object was mapped to *x (the bug did not affect POSIX or
    datetime, and was obvious as it resulted in a shift in dates by
    several decades)*.
-   **Move git repository from Bitbucket to Github.**
-   Set up Github action for CRAN-checks on Windows, OS X and Ubuntu.

# ggpmisc 0.3.7

-   Update `stat_fit_tb()` to support renaming of terms/parameter names
    in the table (Suggested by Big Old Dave and Z. Lin). In addition
    implement selection, reordering and renaming of columns and
    terms/parameters using positional indexes and pattern matching of
    truncated names in addition to whole names. Improve formatting of
    small *P*-values.
-   Update `stat_fmt_tb()` to support the same expanded syntax as
    `stat_fit_tb()`.
-   Add `stat_dens1d_filter()`, `stat_dens1d_filter_g()` and
    `stat_dens1d_labels()`, to complement existing
    `stat_dens2d_filter()`, `stat_dens2d_filter_g()` and
    `stat_dens2d_labels()`.
-   Update `stat_dens2d_filter()`, `stat_dens2d_filter_g()` and
    `stat_dens2d_labels()` adding formal parameters `keep.sparse` and
    `invert.selection`, as available in the new 1D versions.
-   Update `stat_dens2d_labels()` to accept not only character strings
    but also functions as argument to `label.fill` as the new
    `stat_dens1d_labels()` does.
-   Revise documentation including the *User Guide*.

# miscast 0.3.6

-   Override `ggplot2::annotate()` adding support for aesthetics `npcx`
    and `npcy`.
-   Add `stat_summary_xy()` and `stat_centroid()`.
-   Revise `stat_poly_eq()` to support labelling of equations according
    to group.
-   Implement `output.type` `"markdown"` in `stat_poly_eq()` usable with
    `geom_richtext()` from package 'ggtext'.

# ggpmisc 0.3.5

-   Add support for "table themes" to `geom_table()` and
    `geom_table_npc()`.

# ggpmisc 0.3.4

-   Add support for `p.value.label` and `f.value.label` to
    `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Update to track deprecations in 'ggplot2' (>= 3.3.0).

# ggpmisc 0.3.3

-   Fix bug in `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Minor revision of the *User Guide* and documentation.

# ggpmisc 0.3.2

This version implements some new features and fixes bugs in the features
introduced in version 0.3.1, please do rise an issue if you notice any
remaining bugs! Some reported weaknesses in the documentation have been
addressed. This updated version depends on 'ggplot2' (>= 3.2.1).

-   Add support for *volcano* and *quadrant* *plots* of outcomes.

-   Add geometries `geom_vhlines()` and `geom_quadrant_lines()`.

-   Add convenience scales `scale_x_logFC()` and `scale_y_logFC()` for
    data expressed as fold change.

-   Add convenience scales `scale_x_Pvalue()`, scale_y\_Pvalue(),
    `scale_x_FDR()`, `scale_y_FDR()`.

-   Add convenience scales `scale_colour_outcome()`,
    `scale_fill_outcome()` and `scale_shape_outcome()` for data
    expressed as ternary or binary outcomes.

-   Add conversion functions `outcome2factor()` and `threshold2factor()`
    to convert vectors of numeric outcomes into factors with 2 or 3
    levels.

-   Add conversion function `xy_outcomes2factor()` and
    `xy_thresholds2factor()` to combine two vectors of numeric outcomes
    into a 4-level factor.

-   Improve support for model-fit annotations.

-   Update `stat_poly_eq()` so that optionally instead of text labels it
    can return numeric values extracted from the fit object.

-   Document with examples how to pass weights and covariates to
    statistics based on methods from package 'broom'. Highlight the
    differences among `stat_poly_eq()` and the `stat_fit_xxx()`
    statistics implemented using package 'broom'.

-   Revise `stat_apply_fun()` to allow simultaneous application of
    functions to *x* and *y* aesthetics, and handling of `diff()` and
    other functions returning slightly shorter vectors than their input.

-   Support in `stat_fit_tb()`, `stat_fit_augment()`, `stat_fit_tidy()`
    and `stat_fit_glance()` the use of character strings as position
    arguments for parameters `label.x` and `label.y` when using geoms
    based on *x* and *y* aesthetics in addition to when using those
    taking the `npcx` and `npcy` aesthetics.

# ggpmisc 0.3.1

This is a major update, with a few cases in which old code may need to
be revised to work, and many cases in which there will be subtle
differences in the positions of labels used as annotations. The many new
features may still have some bugs, please do rise an issue if you notice
one!

Version requiring 'ggplot2' (>= 3.1.0).

Add new geometries, several of them accepting *x* and *y* in *npc* units
through the new aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy`, allowing positioning
relative to plotting area irrespective of native data units and scale
limits. These geometries are useful on their own for annotations in
particular they allow consistent positioning of textual summaries. By
default they do not inherit the plot's aesthetic mappings making their
behaviour remain by default in-between that of true geometries and that
of annotate().

-   Add `geom_text_npc()` and `geom_label_npc()` using aesthetics npcx
    and npcy.
-   Add `geom_table_npc()` using aesthetics npcx and npcy.
-   Add `geom_plot()` and `geom_plot_npc()` which can be used to add
    inset plots to a ggplot.
-   Add `geom_grob()` and `geom_grob_npc()` which can be used to add
    inset *grobs* to a ggplot.
-   Add `geom_x_margin_point()`, `geom_y_margin_point()`,
    `geom_x_margin_arrow()` and `geom_y_margin_arrow()` which behave
    similarly to `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` but plot points or
    arrows instead of lines. Add `geom_x_margin_grob()` and
    `geom_y_margin_grob()` with similar behaviour but for adding
    *grobs*.
-   Revise textual-summary statistics to use the new *npc* version of
    geometries.
-   This may break old code that used `geom_table()` and depended on the
    old default of `inherit.aes=TRUE`.
-   Add "summarize" statistics for groups and panels.
-   Add `stat_apply_panel()` and `stat_apply_group()`.
-   Add workaround to `stat_fit_glance()` and improve diagnosis of
    unsupported input. Replace bad example in the corresponding
    documentation (workaround for bug reported by Robert White).
-   Update documentation.
-   Add and revise examples.
-   Revise vignette.

# ggpmisc 0.3.0

Version requiring 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0), now in CRAN. **Low level
manipulation and debug methods and functions moved to new package
'gginnards' available through CRAN.**

-   Remove debug stats and geoms -> 'gginnards'.
-   Remove layer manipulation functions -> 'gginnards'.
-   Add support for "weight" aesthetic in `stat_poly_eq()` (fixing bug
    reported by S.Al-Khalidi).
-   Add support for column selection and renaming to `stat_fit_tb()`.
-   Add new statistic `stat_fmt_tb()` for formatting of tibbles for
    addition to plots as tables.
-   Rename `stat_quadrat_count()` into `stat_quadrant_count()`
    (miss-spelling).
-   Revise vignette.

# ggpmisc 0.2.17.9902

Non-CRAN version with additional functionality, but requiring the
development version of 'ggplot2'.

-   Track code breaking change in 'ggplot2' commit #2620 (2018-05-17).

# ggpmisc 0.2.17.9900

Non-CRAN version with additional functionality, but requiring the
development version of 'ggplot2' \>= 2.2.1.9000 (>= commit of
2017-02-09) from Github. Visit

-   `geom_table()`, a geom for adding a layer containing one or more
    tables to a plot panel.
-   `stat_fit_tb()` a stat that computes a tidy tabular version of the
    summary or ANOVA table from a model fit.

# ggpmisc 0.2.17

CRAN version

-   Add `stat_quadrat_count()` a stat that computes the number of
    observations in each quadrant of a plot panel ignoring grouping.

-   Fix bugs, one of which is code breaking: the names of returned
    parameter estimates have changed in `stat_fit_tidy()` now pasting
    `"_estimate"` to avoid name clashes with mapped variables.

# ggpmisc 0.2.16

-   Revise `stat_fit_tidy()` so that it returns *p*-values for
    parameters, in addition to estimates and their standard errors.
-   BUG FIX: Revise `geom_debug()` adding missing default arguments.
-   Add functions for manipulation of layers in ggplot objects:
    `delete_layers()`, `append_layers()`, `move_layers()`,
    `shift_layers()`, `which_layers()`, `extract_layers()`,
    `num_layers()`, `top_layer()` and `bottom_layer()`.

# ggpmisc 0.2.15

Add `stat_fit_tidy()` implemented using `broom::tidy()`. Makes it
possible to add the fitted equation for any fitted model supported by
package 'broom', as long as the user supplies within `aes()` the code to
build a label string. Update user guide.

# ggpmisc 0.2.14

Fix bug in `stat_poly_equation()` `eq.x.rhs` argument ignored when using
expressions.

# ggpmisc 0.2.13

-   Fix bugs in `try_tibble()` and `try_data_frame()` which made them
    fail silently with some objects of class `"ts"` in the case of
    numeric (decimal date) index for time. In addition lack of special
    handling for classes `"yearmon"` and `"yearqrt"` from package 'zoo',
    lead to erroneous date shifts by a few days.
-   Add methods `ggplot.ts()` and `ggplot.xts()`.

# ggpmisc 0.2.12

-   Change default value for parameter `label.fill` in
    `stat_dens2d_labels()` from `NA` to `""`.
-   Improve documentation using current 'ggrepel' version, which
    implements changes that make `stat_dens2d_labels()` useful.

# ggpmisc 0.2.11

-   Add `stat_dens2d_labels()`, a statistic that resets label values to
    `NA` by default, or any character string supplied as argument, in
    regions of a panel with high density of observations.

-   Add `stat_den2d_filter()`, a statistic that filters-out/filters-in
    observations in regions of a panel with high density of
    observations. These two statistics are useful for labeling or
    highlighting observations in regions of a panel with low density.
    Both stats use a compute_panel function.

-   Add `stat_den2d_filter_g()`, a statistic that filters-out/filters-in
    observations in regions of a group with high density of
    observations. This statistics is useful for highlighting
    observations. It uses a compute_group function. They use internally
    `MASS:kde2d` to estimate densities and default values for parameters
    are adjusted dynamically based on the number of observations.

# ggpmisc 0.2.10

-   Add user-requested feature: allow user to specify number 'digits'
    used in formatting numbers in labels in `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Update `try_data_frame()` to return an object of class `"tibble"`
    and add `try_tibble()` as synonym.
-   Update documentation and start using package 'staticdocs' to build a
    documentation web site.

# ggpmisc 0.2.9

-   Add support for *tikz* in `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Fix bug in `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Fix bug in `geom_debug()`.
-   Fix bug in `stat_fit_augment()`.

# ggpmisc 0.2.8

-   Enhance `stat_poly_eq()` so that 1) position of labels according to
    *npc* (relative positions using normalized coordinates), as well as
    by named positions `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"right"`, `"left"` and
    `"center"` is now implemented; 2) when grouping is present, suitable
    `vjust` values are computed to automatically position the labels for
    the different groups without overlap. Default label positions are
    now relative to the range of each panel's $x$ and $y$ scales,
    eliminating in most cases the need to manually tweak label
    positions.

-   Add `stat_fit_glance()` uses package 'broom' for maximum flexibility
    in model function choice when wanting to add labels based on
    information from a model fit, at the expense of very frequently
    having to explicitly set aesthetics, and always having to add code
    to do the formatting of the values to be used in labels. Label
    position is as described above for `stat_poly_eq()`.

-   Add `stat_fit_deviations()` for highlighting residuals in plots of
    fitted models. This statistic currently supports only `lm()` fits.
    By default geom "segment" is used to highlight the deviations of the
    observations from a fitted model.

-   Add `stat_fit_residuals()` for plotting residuals from a fitted
    model on their own in plots matching plots of `lm` fits plotted with
    `stat_smooth()` even with grouping or facets. This statistic
    currently supports only `lm()` fits. By default geom "point" is used
    to plot the residual from a fitted model.

-   Add preliminary version of `stat_fit_augment()`, which uses package
    'broom' for maximum flexibility in model function choice, to augment
    the data with additional columns of values derived from a model fit.

# ggpmisc 0.2.7

-   Add support for AIC and BIC labels to `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Add pretty-printing of parameter values expressed in engineering
    notation in `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Add support for user-supplied label coordinates in `stat_poly_eq()`.
-   Improve `stat_debug_panel()` and `stat_debug_group()` so that they
    can optionally print to the console a summary of the data received
    as input.
-   Add `geom_debug()`, a geom that summarizes its data input to the
    console, and produces no visible graphical output.

# ggpmisc 0.2.6

-   Add support for user-supplied *lhs* and for user-supplied
    *rhs*-variable name in the equation label in `stat_poly_eq()`.

# ggpmisc 0.2.5

-   Remove one example to remove a package dependency.

# ggpmisc 0.2.4

-   Improve handling of time zones in `try_data_frame()`.
-   Revise documentation and vignette.

# ggpmisc 0.2.3

-   `stat_poly_eq()` changed to include the *lhs* (left hand side) of
    the equation by default.

# ggpmisc 0.2.2

-   Add function `try_data_frame()` to convert R objects including time
    series objects of all classes accepted by `try.xts()` into data
    frames suitable for plotting with `ggplot()`.

-   Update `stat_peaks()` and `stat_valleys()` to work correctly when
    the x aesthetic uses a `Date` or `Datetime` continuous scale such as
    `ggplot()` sets automatically for `POSIXct` variables mapped to the
    *x* aesthetic.

# ggpmisc 0.2.1

-   Rename `stat_debug()` as `stat_debug_group()` and add
    `stat_debug_panel()`.
-   Add `stat_peaks()` and `stat_valleys()` (these are simpler versions
    of `ggspectra::stat_peaks()` and `ggspectra::stat_valleys()` for use
    with any numerical data (rather than light spectra).

# ggpmisc 0.1.0

*First version.*

-   Add `stat_poly_eq()`
-   Add `stat_debug()`
