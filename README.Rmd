[![cran version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ggpp)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggpp) 
[![R build status](https://github.com/aphalo/ggpp/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aphalo/ggpp/actions)

## Purpose

Package '**ggpp**' provides a set of building blocks that extend the Grammar of
Graphics implemented in package 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0). New geoms support insets
in plots, marginal marks and the use of native plot coordinates (npc). Position
functions implement new approaches to nudging usable with any geometry, but
especially useful together with `geom_text_linked()`, `geom_text_repel()` and
`geom_label_repel()`.

## Extended Grammar of graphics

### Geometries

Geometries `geom_table()`, `geom_plot()` and `geom_grob()` make it possible to
add inset tables, inset plots, and arbitrary 'grid' graphical objects including
bitmaps and vector graphics as layers to a ggplot using native coordinates for
`x` and `y`.

Geometries `geom_text_npc()`, `geom_label_npc()`, `geom_table_npc()`,
`geom_plot_npc()` and `geom_grob_npc()`, `geom_text_npc()` and
`geom_label_npc()` are versions of geometries that accept positions on _x_
and _y_ axes using aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy` values expressed in "npc" units.

Geometries `geom_x_margin_arrow()`, `geom_y_margin_arrow()`,
`geom_x_margin_grob()`, `geom_y_margin_grob()`, `geom_x_margin_point()` and
`geom_y_margin_point()` make it possible to add marks along the _x_ and _y_
axes. `geom_vhlines()` and `geom_quadrant_lines()` draw vertical and horizontal
reference lines within a single layer.

Geometry `geom_text_linked()` connects text drawn at a nudged position to
the original position, usually that of a point being labelled.

### Aesthetics and scales

Scales `scale_npcx_continuous()` and  `scale_npcy_continuous()` and the
corresponding new aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy` make it possible to add graphic
elements and text to plots using coordinates expressed in `npc` units for the
location within the plotting area.

### Statistics

Statistic `stat_fmt_tb()` helps with the formatting of tables to be plotted
with `geom_table()`. 

Four statistics, `stat_dens2d_filter()`, `stat_dens2d_label()`,
`stat_dens1d_filter()` and `stat_dens1d_label()`, implement tagging or selective
labelling of observations based on the local 2D density of observations in a
panel. Another two statistics, `stat_dens1d_filter_g()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` compute the density by group instead of by plot panel.
These six stats are designed to work well together with `geom_text_repel()` and
`geom_label_repel()` from package 'ggrepel'.

The statistics `stat_apply_panel()` and `stat_apply_group()` can be useful for
applying arbitrary functions returning numeric vectors. They are specially
useful with functions lime `cumsum()`, `cummax()` and `diff()`.

## Position functions

New position functions implementing different flavours of nudging are provided:
`position_nudge_keep()`, `position_nudge_to()`, `position_nudge_center()` and
`position_nudge_line()`. These last two functions make it possible to apply
nudging that varies automatically according to the relative position of points
with respect to arbitrary points or lines, or with respect to a polynomial or
smoothing spline fitted on-the-fly to the the observations. In contrast to
`ggplot2::position_nudge()` all these functions return the repositioned and
original _x_ and _y_ coordinates.

## History

This package is a "spin-off" from package 'ggpmisc' containing extensions to the
grammar originally written for use wihtin 'ggpmisc'. As 'ggpmisc' has grown in
size, spliting it into two packages seems the best option. For the time being,
package 'ggpmisc' will import and re-export visible defintions from 'ggpp'.

## Examples

```{r readme-02, message=FALSE}
library(ggpp)
library(ggrepel)
library(dplyr)
```

A plot with an inset table.

```{r, readme-03}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(wt = mean(wt), mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(wt = sprintf("%.2f", wt),
         mpg = sprintf("%.1f", mpg)) -> tb

df <- tibble(x = 5.45, y = 34, tb = list(tb))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_table(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, label = tb))
```

A plot with an inset plot. With the inset plot positioned using native plot 
coordinates (npc) and using keywords insted of numerical values in the range
0..1 which are also accepted.

```{r, readme-06}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_boxplot() +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Engine cylinders (number)") +
  theme_bw(9) + theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotate("plot_npc", npcx = "left", npcy = "bottom", label = p) +
  expand_limits(y = 0, x = 0)
```
Marginal markings

```{r}
data.tb <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(wt = mean(wt), mpg = mean(mpg))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_x_margin_arrow(data = data.tb,
                      aes(xintercept = wt, color = factor(cyl)),
                      arrow.length = 0.05) +
  geom_y_margin_arrow(data = data.tb,
                      aes(yintercept = mpg, color = factor(cyl)),
                      arrow.length = 0.05) +
  annotate("plot_npc", npcx = "right", npcy = "top", 
           label = p + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())) +
  expand_limits(y = 10) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) 
```

## Documentation 

HTML documentation for the package, including help pages and the _User Guide_,
is available at (https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpp/).

News about updates are regularly posted at (https://www.r4photobiology.info/).

Chapter 7 in Aphalo (2020) explains both basic concepts of the gramamr of
graphics as implemented in 'ggplot2' as well as extensions to this grammar 
including several of those made available by packages 'ggpp' and 'ggpmisc'.
