[![cran version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ggpp)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggpp) 
[![R build status](https://github.com/aphalo/ggpp/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aphalo/ggpp/actions)

## Purpose

Package '**ggpp**' provides a set of building blocks that extend the Grammar of
Graphics implemented in package 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0). New "geoms" support insets
in plots, marginal marks and the use of native plot coordinates (npc). Position
functions implement new approaches to nudging usable with any geometry, but
especially useful together with `geom_text_s()`, `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` and
`ggrepel::geom_label_repel()`.

## Extended Grammar of graphics

### Geometries

Geometries `geom_table()`, `geom_plot()` and `geom_grob()` make it possible to
add inset tables, inset plots, and arbitrary 'grid' graphical objects including
bitmaps and vector graphics as layers to a ggplot using native coordinates for
`x` and `y`.

Geometries `geom_text_npc()`, `geom_label_npc()`, `geom_table_npc()`,
`geom_plot_npc()` and `geom_grob_npc()`, `geom_text_npc()` and
`geom_label_npc()` are versions of geometries that accept positions on _x_
and _y_ axes using aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy` values expressed in "npc" units.

Geometries `geom_x_margin_arrow()`, `geom_y_margin_arrow()`,
`geom_x_margin_grob()`, `geom_y_margin_grob()`, `geom_x_margin_point()` and
`geom_y_margin_point()` make it possible to add marks along the _x_ and _y_
axes. `geom_vhlines()` and `geom_quadrant_lines()` draw vertical and horizontal
reference lines within a single layer.

Geometries `geom_text_s()`, `geom_label_s()`, `geom_point_s()`, `geom_table()`,
`geom_plot()` and `geom_grob()` connect (by default) the plot elements added at
a nudged position to the original position with a segment or arrow.

### Aesthetics and scales

Scales `scale_npcx_continuous()` and  `scale_npcy_continuous()` and the
corresponding new aesthetics `npcx` and `npcy` make it possible to add graphic
elements and text to plots using coordinates expressed in `npc` units for the
location within the plotting area.

### Statistics

Statistic `stat_fmt_tb()` helps with the formatting of tables to be plotted
with `geom_table()`. 

Four statistics, `stat_dens2d_filter()`, `stat_dens2d_label()`,
`stat_dens1d_filter()` and `stat_dens1d_label()`, implement tagging or selective
labelling of observations based on the local 2D density of observations in a
panel. Another two statistics, `stat_dens1d_filter_g()` and
`stat_dens1d_filter_g()` compute the density by group instead of by plot panel.
These six statistics are designed to work well together with `geom_text_repel()`
and `geom_label_repel()` from package 'ggrepel'.

The statistics `stat_apply_panel()` and `stat_apply_group()` are useful for
applying arbitrary functions returning numeric vectors like `cumsum()`, 
`cummax()` and `diff()`. Statistics `stat_centroid()` and `stat_summary_xy()` 
allow computation of summaries on both _x_ and _y_ and passing them to a
geom.

## Position functions

Position functions implementing different flavours of nudging are provided:
`position_nudge_keep()`, `position_nudge_to()`, `position_nudge_center()` and
`position_nudge_line()`. These last two functions make it possible to apply
nudging that varies automatically according to the relative position of points
with respect to arbitrary points or lines, or with respect to a polynomial or
smoothing spline fitted on-the-fly to the the observations.

Position functions `position_stacknudge()`, `position_fillnudge()`,
`position_jitternudge()`, `position_dodgenudge()` and `position_dodge2nudge()`
each combines the roles of two _position_ functions. They make it possible to
easily nudge labels in plot layers that use stacking, dodging or jitter.
Functions `position_jitter_keep()`, `position_stack_keep()`,
`position_fill_keep()`, `position_dodge_keep()`, `position_dosge2_keep()` behave
like the positions from 'ggplot2' but keep in data the original coordinates.

In contrast to position functions from 'ggplot2' all these position functions
keep the original _x_ and _y_ coordinates when displacing them. This makes them
compatible with the repulsive geometries from package 'ggrepel' (>= 0.9.1) as
well as with `geom_text_s()`, `geom_point_s()`, `geom_table()`, `geom_plot()`
and `geom_grob()` from this package. All these geoms can draw segments or arrows
connecting the original positions to the displaced positions. They remain
backwards compatible and can be used in all geometries that have a `position`
formal parameter.

## Justification

Justifications `"outward_mean"`, `"inward_mean"`, `"outward_median"` and
`"inward_median"` implementing outward and inward justification relative to the
centroid of the data instead of to the center of the $x$ or $y$ scales.
Justification outward or inward from an arbitrary origin is also supported.

## History

This package is a "spin-off" from package 'ggpmisc' containing extensions to the
grammar originally written for use wihtin 'ggpmisc'. As 'ggpmisc' had grown in
size, splitting it into two packages was necessary to easy development and 
maintenance and to facilitate imports into other packages. For the time being,
package 'ggpmisc' imports and re-exports all visible definitions from 'ggpp'.

## Examples

The plots below exemplify some of the things that 'ggpp' makes possible or 
makes easier to code compared to 'ggplot' used by itself. Additional examples 
including several combining 'ggpp' and 'ggrepel' are provided in the package 
vignette.

```{r readme-02, message=FALSE}
library(ggpp)
library(ggrepel)
library(dplyr)
```

### Insets

A plot with an inset table.

```{r, readme-03}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(wt = mean(wt), mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(wt = sprintf("%.2f", wt),
         mpg = sprintf("%.1f", mpg)) -> tb

df <- tibble(x = 5.45, y = 34, tb = list(tb))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_table(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, label = tb))
```

A plot with an inset plot. 

Inset plot positioned using native plot coordinates (npc) and using keywords
insted of numerical values in the range 0..1 which are also accepted.

```{r, readme-06}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_boxplot() +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Engine cylinders (number)") +
  theme_bw(9) + theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotate("plot_npc", npcx = "left", npcy = "bottom", label = p) +
  expand_limits(y = 0, x = 0)
```

### Centroids

Means computed on-the-fly and shown as asterisks.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_centroid(shape = "asterisk", size = 6)
```

Medians computed on-the-fly displayed marginal arrows.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_centroid(geom = "y_margin_arrow", .fun = median,
                aes(yintercept = after_stat(y)), arrow.length = 0.05)
```

### Nudging and stacking combined

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x1 = c(1, 2, 1, 3, -1),
                 x2 = c("a", "a", "b", "b", "b"),
                 grp = c("some long name", "other name", "some name",
                         "another name", "a name"))

# Add labels to a horizontal column plot (stacked by default)
ggplot(data = df, aes(x2, x1, group = grp)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = grp), width=0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = grp),
    position = position_stacknudge(vjust = 1, y = -0.2)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Acknowledgement

Being an extension to package 'ggplot2', some of the code in package 'ggpp' has been created by using as a template that from layer functions and scales in 'ggplot2'. The user interface of 'ggpp' aims at being as consistent as possible with 'ggplot2' and the layered grammar of graphics (Wickham 2010). New features added in 'ggplot2' are added when relevant to 'ggpp', such as support for `orientation` for flipping of layers. This package does consequently indirectly include significant contributions from several of the authors and maintainers of 'ggplot2', listed at (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
